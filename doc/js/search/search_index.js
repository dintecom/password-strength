The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatPasswordStrengthModule .forRoot()):\nimport {

the mat-form-field correctly after changing the value of the password's strength, please consider\nto change the detection strategy for the parent component --> \nimport {ChangeDetectionStrategy,

\nClient Side password's validation using a built in angular formController\n\nadd an input element to your template with an appropriate @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component\nhold a reference of the @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component by adding passwordComponentWithValidation (or whatever you want) inside the element\n\ne.g: \n \n                       \nbind the form controller of the mat-password-strength to the input element \n\nyou can access the form controller of @angular-material-extensions/password-strength using the chile view --> passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\nbind the form controller to an input element --> [formControl]=\"passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\"\n\n\nFull example - see below\n\n\n\n  \n    Password\n    \n    \n      {{passwordWithValidation.value.length}} / 25\n    \n    \n      Password is required\n    \n    \n      Password is not valid\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n
