Please do not hesitate to contact us!\nAlternatively, provide a PR | open an appropriate issue here\nIf did you like this project, support angular-material-extensions \nby starring :star: and sharing it :loudspeaker:\nTable of Contents\n\nDemo\nComponents\nDependencies\nInstallation\nAPI\nUsage\nRun Demo App Locally\nDevelopment\nOther Angular Libraries\nSupport\nLicense\n\n\n\nDemo\nView all the directives and components in action at https://angular-material-extensions.github.io/password-strength\n\n\nLibrary's components\n\n used to calculate and display the strength of a provided password\n\nstrength score \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nstrength score \n\n\n  \n\n\n\nstrength score > 80%\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n used to display more information about the strength of a provided password\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\nAngular developed and tested with 7.x\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n1. Install via ng add. (Recommended)\nIf Angular Material Design is not setup, just run ng add @angular/material learn more\nNow add the library via the angular schematics\nng add @angular-material-extensions/password-strength2. Install via npm. (Alternative)\nNow install @angular-material-extensions/password-strength via:\nnpm install --save @angular-material-extensions/password-strength\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for @angular-material-extensions/password-strength:\nmap: {\n  '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength': 'node_modules/@angular-material-extensions/password-strength/bundles/password-strength.umd.js',\n}\n-> follow the instructions here \n\nImport the library\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatPasswordStrengthModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatPasswordStrengthModule:\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n\nAPI\n used

without any input fields\nor similar.\nIn the following example, we integration a material input container with @angular-material-extensions/password-strength 's component.\nNOTE: In order to repaint the mat-form-field correctly after changing the value of the password's strength, please consider\nto change the detection strategy for the parent component --> \nimport {ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, OnInit, ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';\nimport {Title} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {MatSlideToggleChange} from '@angular/material';\nimport {MatPasswordStrengthComponent} from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  templateUrl: './home.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss'],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,\n  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush\n})\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {}\n  \n

how to use the emitted strength of the password in your template\n\n   \n   \n   \n     done\n   \n   \n     error\n   \n   \n     Password's strength = {{passwordComponent.strength}} %100\n   \nClient Side password's validation using a built in angular formController\n\nadd an input element to your template with an appropriate @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component\nhold a reference of the @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component by adding passwordComponentWithValidation (or whatever you want) inside the element\n\ne.g: \n \n                       \nbind the form controller of the mat-password-strength to the input element \n\nyou can access the form controller of @angular-material-extensions/password-strength using the chile view --> passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\nbind the form controller to an input element --> [formControl]=\"passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\"\n\n\nFull example - see below\n\n\n\n  \n    Password\n    \n    \n      {{passwordWithValidation.value.length}} / 25\n    \n    \n      Password is required\n    \n    \n      Password is not valid\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n
